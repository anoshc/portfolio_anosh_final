          Through my three years at NTNU, I have gained extensive expertise in
          modern web development and IoT. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, using React for dynamic applications and Node.js with
          Express for robust back-end services. My skills include Next.js for
          improved performance, Tailwind CSS for customizable interfaces, and
          practical experience with Raspberry Pi. I am adept at managing
          relational databases with MySQL and scalable solutions with MongoDB.
          Additionally, I have extensive experience with GitHub for version
          control and collaborative development, and Trello for agile project
          management.
